yes i know OVMF.fd is available in EDK 2, but its more convienient to have here

to run it on bare metal:

1. format a usb drive or something with a gpt and fat-32 filesystem
2. copy the contents of zig-out onto the root of the usb drive
3. plug it into the device to boot into the program and select the option in the boot manager
